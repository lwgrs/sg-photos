<p>Over the weekend I was listening to some music on my iPod Touch rather than streaming, and took my dog out for a walk through our nearby mini forest. I left my phone at the house, and the thought struck to take some pictures. I've never really tested my iPod and wanted to see what it could do, especially since I would like to try using it with my binoculars (my phone is too big to use with the rig to attach a phone to the lens). So, here are the results!</p>

<p>I liked the cooler colour temperature from this photo so I thought I would edit it to bring it out a bit in Lightroom Mobile, but ended up using one of the free presets I found:</p>

<p>I like the way this photo turned out considering the limited capabilities of this camera (compared to any smartphone camera out there):</p>
