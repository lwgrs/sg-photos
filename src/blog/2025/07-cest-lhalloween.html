<p><em>In case you're interested, the title of this post is inspired by a French song we heard every year in elementary school: <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/music/read/c-est-l-halloween-the-story-behind-the-greatest-french-halloween-song-ever-1.5051204">C'est l'Halloween by Matt Maxwell</a>.</em></p>

<p>Last year I shared a <a href="/2024/the-monster-in-your-mind/">homemade Halloween decoration</a> - it was amazing and crafted with love. This year the same neighbours put up another decoration: I think it's a big spider.</p>

<p>It's a lot more elaborate than last year's, and unfortunately the only photos I have of it are some daylight shots post heavy rainfall when it fell apart; and a badly lit night shot that I tried enhancing in Lightroom Mobile. Still, this was an amazing homemade decoration and I look forward to what they'll come up with next year.</p>

<p>All photos were taken with my Samsung Galaxy S21+ rear camera, using the 64MP setting.</p>
