<p>There's a short street near my office that I've been to several times. The houses are townhomes, tightly stacked together. I suspect it may be a condo unit.</p>
<p>The doors I photographed here are the most colourful; the rest are the same dull shade so these ones stand out. I took a photo and edited two versions: one slightly more muted, and the other a bit more vibrant.</p>
<p>One of the things I especially like about the photo is the reflection of the doors in the wet pavement.</p>
<p>The photo was taken using my Samsung Galaxy S21+ Rear Telephoto Camera.</p>
