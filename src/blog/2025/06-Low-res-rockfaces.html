<p>Back in April, I went for a long walk with my dog. I wanted to get some good exercise, and tiring out my dog was a bonus. I thought it would be cooler out but ended up quite warm. The other purpose was to get some photos using my <a href="https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/bad-photos/">"disposable lens"</a>.</p>

<p>The result was unsurprising - the photos aren't the highest quality and I was limited in terms of framing the images. I quite like the results, and enjoyed the challenge. I like how in the second picture of the rocks, you can see some faces there.</p>

<p>All photos were taken with the <strong>Sony ILCE-5000</strong>, using a "disposable lens".</p>
