<p>This past Monday, <a href="https://www.hiro.report/photochallenge/">Hiro's Photo Composition Challenge</a> started, beginning with the Rule of Thirds - a basic photography composition challenge that most beginner photographers learn. I use a 3x3 grid overlayed on all of my photos when lining them up, but I can't say that I actively focus on the "rule".</p>
<p>Here are some photos I took to demonstrate the rule of thirds. I will be uploading all of my photos to a single <a href="https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjC38cU">Flickr album</a> but will be making individual posts highlighting specific photos. Click through on the photos to see the full size.</p>
<p>All photos this week were taken with my Samsung SM-G996W main camera; specific settings are noted in the captions. There was minimal Lightroom editing done except in one or two cases.</p>
