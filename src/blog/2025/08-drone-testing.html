<p>My wife gifted me a drone for Christmas - the DJI Mini 4K. I've <a href="/tags/drone/">dabbled with drones before</a> but only to fly my friend's drone for a few minutes at a time. I may have taken some pictures or video...but none were "my own". Well, now I have one!</p>

<p>I haven't given it a proper test, between high winds and winter storms, but we took it out for a few minutes over the weekend and I took some test shots. Listed below are the original, followed by two edits in Lightroom Mobile (my own is "Edit 1", "Edit 2" is the auto setting in Lightroom).</p>

<p>I wish I had the specific camera information, but unfortunately that information was not recorded to the image meta data.</p>
