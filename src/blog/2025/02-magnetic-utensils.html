<p>I discovered a long time ago at certain restaurants that utensils are occasionally magnetic. This usually happens if they are made of a metal that is naturally magnetic and are exposed a magnetic field of some sort. I'm not sure what kind of magnetic fields are present at restaurants, but I always check to see if my knife and fork stick together.</p>
<p>At the most recent dining experience, my knife was <em>extremely</em> magnetic and I could lift the fork clear off the table.</p>
