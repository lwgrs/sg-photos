<p>For week 3 of Hiro's composition challenge, we were to demonstrate the use of frames in a photo. The goal was to frame a subject within the frame of the picture. No specific requirements for this, anything could be used to make up a frame. We had some bad weather this week so I didn't get the chance to go outdoors very often.</p> 

<p>Photos were shot with either my Sony &alpha;5000 or Samsung Galaxy S21+. Some photos were edited in Adobe Lightroom Classic or Mobile. I attempted to infuse some colour in some of my photos this week - I've been a little jealous of some of the other entries that just <em>pop</em> that other people are taking.</p>
