<p>On New Year's Day, my wife and I went for a walk in nearby Sunshine Alley. We took our dog so that she had an opportunity to run around freely, off-leash. She loves this place and bounds around the snow. More photos of our dog to come, but for now here is what ended up being a perfect image to me that I captured on my phone (instead of the camera I had been carrying the whole time, which was stowed away in the carrying case). And a bonus picture including Bailey.</p>
