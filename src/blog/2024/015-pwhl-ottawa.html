<p>On Friday December 6th, my wife and I went to see the Ottawa Charge take on the Montreal Victoire for a PWHL game at the Canadian Tire Centre. We won tickets in my company's suite, in the 100 level. The suite is at the top of the section, so we had a great view of the action. The play is different from NHL in a few ways - there are some interesting rule tweaks designed to generate more offence - and the skill level is a little bit below that of NHL players. But the PWHL represents the top talent in women's hockey, and overall it was a great game. Unfortunately, the Charge lost the game 2-1 in regulation time.</p>
<p>It took a little bit of time but the orange and yellow colour scheme for the team has grown on me. I'm happy that the team went with different colours than the usual red and black scheme that the sports teams in town tend to go with. I think it's a little silly that all teams should follow the same colour scheme, it's not necessary in my opinion.</p>
