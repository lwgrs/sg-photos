I took this photo 20 days ago (along with a few other photos of the bookstore), but never really did anything with it. I might have shared it to social media, I don't know.

It's a neat little book store, selling both used and new books alike. It's also a cafe serving an assortment of hot (and cold) beverages as well as beer, if you're into that.
