<p>I was out walking at lunch yesterday and was keeping my eyes open for some interesting "banal", everyday photo opportunities. Leading lines are always interesting visually, so I was drawn to this intersection of vetical and horizontal power lines. I'm not particularly thrilled with the result, but I still like the lines.</p>
<p>The photos were all taken with my Samsung Galaxy S21+ rear telephoto camera. Æ’/2.0, 5.9 mm, 1/1150, ISO 25.</p>
