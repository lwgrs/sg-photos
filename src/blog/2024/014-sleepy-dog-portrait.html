<p>My dog Bailey sure knows how to set her cuteness factor to 11. Her most effective pose is when she's got her eyes closed and appears to be sleeping. But as we all know, dogs are always on alert and can wake up at a moment's notice (and just as easily go back to sleep).</p>
<p>Both photos were taken using my Samsung Galaxy S21+ Rear Main Camera, in Portrait mode.</p>
