<p>I can't believe I have a photo blog and haven't shared a picture of my dog. She is probably the most photographed subject in my phone's camera roll. Despite her best efforts to avoid photos (she is notorious for moving out of the way or ruining a candid shot), I usually manage to get something good.</p>
