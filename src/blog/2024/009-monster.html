<p>Our neighbourhood seems to be getting into the Halloween spirit in a big way this year. Way more houses are decorated, and creatively at that.</p>
<p>This house is on my regular walk route with my dog. It's such a great job. I wish I was this creative and capable with arts & crafts.</p>
<p>It occurs to me the more I walk by the house that the eyes probably light up at night. I'm hoping I get the chance to see it this week.</p>
