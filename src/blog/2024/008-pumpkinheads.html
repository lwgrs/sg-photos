On Canadian Thanksgiving weekend, my sister-in-law asked us to take photos of her and her friend wearing carved pumpkins on their heads. They did an incredible job - though apparently the pumpkins pressed a little too hard on the nose and was a little uncomfortable. 

These photos are from Sunday October 13, 2024.
