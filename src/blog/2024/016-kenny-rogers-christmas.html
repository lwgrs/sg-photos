meta_description: A house in my neighbourhood really likes red Christmas lights, and it reminded me of a certain TV sitcom episode.

<p>Winter and Christmas provide an excuse for people to decorate their house with inflatables and lighting - not dissimilar to <a href="/2024/the-monster-in-your-mind/">Halloween</a>. In my neighbourhood there is one particular house that caught my eye, but not because it's a shining example of creativity. It's very simple: the house is <strong>red</strong>, like really red. It really reminds me of the <em>Seinfeld</em> episode about a Kenny Rogers Chicken opening across from Kramer's apartment and the bright red lighting.</p>
