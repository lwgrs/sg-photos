<p>I took a lot of photos between September and October this year and until now I didn't get around to pulling them off the camera SD card and save them to my hard drive (and One Drive too, for good measure). I had to take some photos I took of my sister-in-law and her boyfriend on the weekend to fix some of them that had lighting issues, so I took the opportunity to download the rest of the photos I've been sitting on.</p>

<p>I picked a few that I liked and I have them for you here. Some of them are using my <a href="https://lwgrs.bearblog.dev/bad-photos/">cheap plastic lens</a> and others are using proper lenses - I'll note in the captions which is which. Enjoy!</p>
