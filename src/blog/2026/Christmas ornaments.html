Christmas 2025 was a different one for us; on the outside it was much the same - we stayed with my wife's parents for Christmas and New Year's. The events around Christmas were different though, and led us eventually to cooking turkey dinner on Boxing Day, the 26th. 

I took some photos, and I consider them to be slightly artistic. Both of these shots were taken with my Sony Alpha 5000. I put the camera in "Aperture Priority" mode so that I could have a kind of "bokeh" effect.
