<p>My friend Mike wanted to take his <a href="/2024/droning-on/">drone</a> out again and thought that the rapids on the Ottawa River at Bate Island would be an ideal spot. There's a bridge that crosses the river from the Ottawa side over to Gatineau, Quebec, and plenty of water around. Plus, the rapids themselves. We got some great video footage while playing with the drone, but I also brought my camera out to get some shots. It was the first time I've visited the island, despite driving past it multiple times.</p>
<p>All pictures in this set were taken with my Sony ILCE-5000 using a 28-70mm F3.5-5.6 lens.</p>
