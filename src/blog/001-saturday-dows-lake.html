On Saturday July 27th I went for a bike ride to cross the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_William_Commanda_Bridge">Chief William Commanda Bridge</a> in Ottawa, ON. On the way there, I biked along Queen Elizabeth Drive and found this amazing photo opportunity at Dow's Lake. Taken with my Samsung Galaxy S21+, in default/auto mode.
