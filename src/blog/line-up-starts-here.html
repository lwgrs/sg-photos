I made some edits to this photo in Lightroom Mobile. I darkened the image and desaturated some of the colours so that the wall isn't such an ugly colour (it really is an ugly colour), and the white text against the black sign is more of a stark contrast. Additionally I added some grain to the photo because recently I just like grain.
